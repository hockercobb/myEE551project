## Introduction
This is my EE551 python individual project | Author: HAO CAO

## Purposals
As a beginner python learner, it would be interesting to combine the program with my hobbie: painting.Van gogh is my idol, his painting named The Starry Night is my favourite, we cannot paint a mastwepiece like this, but maybe we can creat other pieces with the help of Python! It's amazing!
## Architecture

## Features
- [x] Configure the running environment using the VGG16 model
- [x] Build style transfer platform with keras
- [x] deep learning algorithm
- [x] Let the computer learn the input image style
- [x] Style is digitized by deep learning algorithm
- [x] The target image was processed iteratively to obtain similar style images



## NEED TO TODO
- [ ] Installate some dependent libraries with Anaconda
- [ ] Configure the operating environment
- [ ] Code designing about dimensions of the generated picture and util function to convert a tensor into a valid image.
- [ ] Run the program on Anaconda and input the run statement, get what we want.
