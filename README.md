# Background information: dogs vs. cats!

* from kaggle:

  In 2013, we hosted one of our favorite for-fun competitions:  Dogs vs. Cats. Much has since changed in the machine learning landscape, particularly in deep learning and image analysis. Back then, a tensor flow was the diffusion of the creamer in a bored mathematician's cup of coffee. Now, even the cucumber farmers are neural netting their way to a bounty.

  Much has changed at Kaggle as well. Our online coding environment Kernels didn't exist in 2013, and so it was that we approached sharing by scratching primitive glpyhs on cave walls with sticks and sharp objects. No more. Now, Kernels have taken over as the way to share code on Kaggle. IPython is out and Jupyter Notebook is in. We even have TensorFlow. What more could a data scientist ask for? But seriously, what more? Pull requests welcome.
  
  We are excited to bring back the infamous Dogs vs. Cats classification problem as a playground competition with kernels enabled. Although modern techniques may make light of this once-difficult problem, it is through practice of new techniques on old datasets that we will make light of machine learning's future challenges.
  
# Proposal
   * My project can classify the images into dogs and cats , in field of aritificial intelligence and build web service.
   * Can be used on computer (and mobile-phone), running on the web service.
 
# Todo  /  basic features.

1.Image processing
    ①image cropping and pre-processing,standardizing. 
    ②converse the images that can be use in Tensorflow.

2.Design neural network
    /*  priliminary design */
        
       conv1   conv layer_1
       
       pooling1_lrn  pooling layer_1
        
       conv2  conv layer_2
       
       pooling2_lrn pooling layer_2
        
       local3 pooling layer_1
        
       local4 pooling layer_2
        
       softmax pooling layer_3


3.Training model.
    
   ①create training model.
    
   ②save the model.


4.Classification and recognition
    
# Advanced features

1.Based on moxing(producted by Huawei company) and running by the Huawei cloud with better GPU such get a high speed.

2.Design the web-based interface or client and app on mobile phone.

3.Some function based on client such as accounting management, limits of authority managemen..


# Resource

1. image resoure (data set)from kaggle/google.

2. web-service maybe built on Huawei Cloud.

3. AI function based on tensorflow.
